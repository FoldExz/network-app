# network-app

Cyber Optik is a multifunctional network utility app developed using Flutter. It provides tools for monitoring, securing, and optimizing internet connections. The key features include:

- Speedtest: Measures download/upload speeds, ping, jitter, and packet loss.
- Sniffing: Captures network packets to analyze traffic flow and detect anomalies.
- Terminal (SSH): Enables remote access via SSH with command execution and history tracking.
- VPN: Ensures secure, encrypted internet access with DoH/DoT support.
- SFTP File Transfer: Securely transfers files between devices.

Due to limitations and considerations, the upload server for Speedtest uses a self-hosted server:

This project was developed in 3 months as a semester-end assignment by Arimbi Kusuma Jati, Hari Tammim, and me.
